    "\n",
    "The [**Matplotlib**](https://matplotlib.org/index.html) library provides methods for creating a variety of different kinds of data visualizations, including static, animated, and even interactive visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "[**Pyplot**](https://matplotlib.org/api/pyplot_api.html) is a submodule of Matplotlib. Using the Pyplot module allows us to plot data stored in lists and arrays.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Step 1**\n",

    "\n",
    "Run the code below to import Pyplot.\n",
    "\n",
    "    import matplotlib.pyplot as pltimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "With this command, we've also given pylot an alias, plt, so we don't have to type out matplotlib.pyplot every single time we want to use a function from it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, all functions associated with this class can be accessed with the syntax **plt.FunctionName**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**\n",

    "Let‚Äôs take a closer look at the different statuses of the art in our data set, and see how many pieces of art are in each status.\n",

    "*This is a dataframe contaning information on the status of art, where art can either be \"In place\", \"Removed\" or \"Under review\". On the first row (index 0), we see there are 372 pieces of art that are in place. On the second row (index 1), we see that 124 pieces of art have been removed.

    "#### Speed and power\n",
    "\n",
    "![Speed and power](../_images/Module4-Unit3-image2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a visualization is generated from live data, we should consider how long it takes to load when using older systems or less reliable internet connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "When code is pulling from large or complex data sets to produce a visualization, it can take time to compute all that data. This means the notebook will be slow to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases Jupyter notebooks use remote server resources from the Hub to run code. We can help to optimize visualizations by processing the data using Python before passing that data to the visualization library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üèÅ Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare how long it takes to create a data visualization using two different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating the data visualization at the same time as we download the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Downloading the data set into a DataFrame, then creating the data visualization from the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [**Python time Module**](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/time) to time how long it takes each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter notebook, run the code below to set up the demonstration.\n",
