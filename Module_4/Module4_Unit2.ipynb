    "# Module 4 Unit 2  - Choosing the Right Type of Visualization for your Data\n",
    "\n",
    "*This section contains tutorials! Get the most out of them by opening a Jupyter notebook in another window and following along. Code snippets provided in the course can be pasted directly into your Jupyter notebook. Review Module 2, Unit 5 for a refresher on creating and opening Jupyter notebooks in Callysto.*\n",
    "\n",
    "A visualization is only useful if it helps us to understand our data set better or communicate information about it more accurately and powerfully.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 dogs looking over a wall\n",
    "\n",
    "When choosing to visually represent data, remember what question you want to answer and ask yourself if what the visualization is presenting is relevant to your question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get some practice representing our pets data set from the previous module provided by [Bootstrap World](https://www.bootstrapworld.org/materials/data-science/) in different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the following code in your Jupyter notebook to import the pandas library and recreate the pets DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    #load \"pandas\" library under the alias \"pd\"\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "\n",
    "    #identify the location of our online data\n",

    "#### Code Comments\n",
    "\n",
    "Have you noticed that some lines in code begin with a # symbol and seem to be written in plain English?\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, lines that begin with **#** are **comments** — basically, notes for any humans looking at the code. The # tells the compiler to ignore the line, as it is not intended to be read by a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Comments are useful when teaching others about what specific parts of our code do. They also can help us keep our code organized, remind us about important information, and allow people less familiar with our code to understand it more easily.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🏁 Tutorial: Tutorial: grouping variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Our *pets* data set contains much more data than the lists we used to create data visualizations in Unit 1. For example, the head of the DataFrame shows us that for each animal eight different variables have been recorded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start by picking a few columns we are interested in and get counts of the different values within those columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Gender\n",
    "* Species\n",
    "* Age (in years)\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we'll use the pandas method **groupby**, which lets us split data into groups and give those groups names so they can be easily referenced.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below to group data in the gender, species, and age columns of the pets DataFrame by count.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Group by different Categories: Gender, Species, Age (years)\n",
    "    gender = pets.groupby(\"Gender\").size().reset_index(name=\"Count\")\n",
    "    species = pets.groupby(\"Species\").size().reset_index(name=\"Count\")\n",
    "    age = pets.groupby(\"Age (years)\").size().reset_index(name=\"Count\")\n",
    "    \n",
    "The variable *pets* refers to our DataFrame of information. Writing the code *pets.groupby(\"Gender\")* creates a new dataframe that groups the information by the two genders Male and Female. Extending the line of code to *pets.groupby(\"Gender\").size()* creates a column indicating the size of each group (Male, Female), and appending *reset_index(name=\"Count\")* gives an informative name for this size data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've created our groups, let's call each group name and see what it looks like as a table.\n",
