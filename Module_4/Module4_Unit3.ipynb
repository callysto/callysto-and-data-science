    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![Data Visualization Design](../_images/Module4-Unit3-image.jpeg)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We don't have to be graphic designers to recognize that the way data is presented visually is important. When a data visualization is well-crafted, it's appealing to the viewer and easy for them to access, understand, and make use of.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes data visualizations powerful and practical tools for communicating ideas and presenting arguments. They can also help make information and processing resources available to colleagues and students, empowering them to find answers to questions on their own.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are four goals to keep in mind when creating a data visualization:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Define a purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Know the audience\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Keep it tidy\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Make it accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's explore each one in more detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Design with purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "What question does this visualization answer? The audience should know exactly why they are being shown this information and what to do with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a good time for us to make sure we have the necessary data to answer this question and that our source is reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining a purpose also helps us select the right type of data visualization. Is this particular chart, map, or plot the best tool to represent our idea? If so, why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do we need to show multiple categories or variables? If so, how are they differentiated?\n",
    "\n",
    "It can help to try different kinds of visualizations until we find one that communicates the idea as clearly as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Know the audience\n",
    "\n",
    "Who is this visualization for? Whenever we represent data, we should think about what our audience needs and understands.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the title, legend, and any labels should use terms that are familiar to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or, a visualization intended for a class of 12-year-olds might use less complex language than one for post-graduate academics.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Keep it tidy\n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations that look cluttered or disorganized work against our goal of clear communication.\n",
    "\n",
    "Questions to ask yourself: \n",
    "\n",
    "* Does your visualization look cluttered?\n",
    "* Are you mixing data categories?\n",
    "* Are you attempting to answer more than one question using a single visualization? \n",
    "\n",
    "To be effective, visualizations must be clean and coherent. While it can be exciting to add more elements and variables, data is easier to communicate and navigate when it is presented simply.\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, it's better to create a visualization for each key idea than to try and make a more complex visualization that presents multiple ideas at once.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Make is accessible\n",
    "\n",
    "Not everyone takes in information the same way. Some people experience more challenges than others when accessing and working with data.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, colour is a common tool for differentiating categories in visualizations. However, many people experience full or partial colour-blindness that can make this information hard to interpret.\n",

    "### üèÅ Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "*Get the most out of this activity by opening a Jupyter notebook in another window and following along. Code snippets provided in the course can be pasted directly into your Jupyter notebook. Review Module 2, Unit 5 for a refresher on creating and opening Jupyter notebooks in Callysto.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try applying an inclusive colour palette to a data visualization.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by running the code below to recreate the pets DataFrame. \n",
    "\n",
    "    # load \"pandas\" library under the alias \"pd\"\n",
    "    import pandas as pd\n",
    "    import plotly.express as px\n",
    "\n",
    "    # identify the location of our online data\n",
    "    url = \"https://tinyurl.com/y917axtz-pets\"\n",
    "\n",
    "    # read csv file from url and create a dataframe\n",
    "    pets = pd.read_csv(url)\n",
    "\n",
    "    # display the head of the data\n",
    "    pets.head()\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, use the groupby function to select counts of each species in our data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    species = pets.groupby(\"Species\").size().reset_index(name=\"Count\")\n",
    "    species\n",
    "    \n",
    "![head](../_images/Module4-Unit3-image1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*This is a dataframe that indicates there are five different species in the dataset, and tells us how many of each pet is within the dataset. From the first row (index 0), we see there are 11 cats, from the second row (index 1), there are 15 dogs, from the third row (index 2) there are 2 lizards, from the fourth row (index 3), there are 2 rabbits, and from the fifth row (index 4) there is only 1 tarantula.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Generate a pie chart of the different species in our data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "    colour_list1 = ['#ffffcc','#a1dab4','#41b6c4','#2c7fb8','#253494']\n",
    "\n",
    "    fig = px.pie(species,values=\"Count\",names=\"Species\",title=\"Species of pets\",color_discrete_sequence=colour_list1)\n",
    "\n",
    "    fig.show()\n",
    "    \n",
    "The numbers in *colour_list1* represent colours as six hexidecimal digits (the sixteen digits 0, 1, 2, . . . , 9, 8, a, b, c, d, e, f). The number *#ff0000* represents the colour Red, #00ff00 is the colour Green and *#0000ff* is the colour Blue. Adding combinations of these three basic colours give all the colours of the rainbow. Usually we look up the colours we want in a chart.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output should look like this:  ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 4**\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, visit [**ColorBrewer 2.0**](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=sequential&scheme=BuGn&n=3), a free online diagnostic tool for evaluating color schemes used in maps and other data visualizations.\n",
    "\n",
    "In ColorBrewer 2, generate a new colour scheme for the pie chart that is both suitable for our data and is friendly to people who experience colour blindness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Update the code for the pie chart to reflect the new colours.\n",

    "### Additional considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "While data visualizations can be a powerful tool for analyzing data and communicating insight, there are limitations we should consider when using them.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Speed and power\n",
    "\n",
    "![Speed and power](../_images/Module4-Unit3-image2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "If a visualization is generated from live data, we should consider how long it takes to load when using older systems or less reliable internet connections.\n",
    "\n",
    "When code is pulling from large or complex data sets to produce a visualization, it can take time to compute all that data. This means the notebook will be slow to respond.\n",
    "\n",
    "In most cases Jupyter notebooks use remote server resources from the Hub to run code. We can help to optimize visualizations by processing the data using Python before passing that data to the visualization library.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### üèÅ Activity\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare how long it takes to create a data visualization using two different methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generating the data visualization at the same time as we download the data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Downloading the data set into a DataFrame, then creating the data visualization from the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [**Python time Module**](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/time) to time how long it takes each method.\n",
    "\n",
    "In your Jupyter notebook, run the code below to set up the demonstration.\n",
    "\n",
    "    # Get data from URL\n",
    "    import requests as r\n",
