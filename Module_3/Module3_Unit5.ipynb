    "# Module 3 Unit 5  - Working with Text Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Qualitative data can be a rich source of insight for those who know how to work with it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this unit, we'll focus on textual data rather than images, audio, or other qualitative data formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Specifically, we'll explore some tools that can:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Translate data from one language to another\n",
    "* Check for spelling errors\n",
    "* Convert text to speech\n",
    "* Analyse natural language\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the examples in this unit use the pets DataFrame from earlier in the course. If you need to recreate it, run the following code in your Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    from pandas import DataFrame, read_csv\n",
    "    url = \"https://tinyurl.com/y917axtz-pets\"\n",
    "    pets = read_csv(url)\n",
    "    pets.head()\n",
    "\n",
    "The result should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "![pet df](../_images/Module3-Unit5-image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*First five rows of a DataFrame containing data on pet adoption. DataFrame contains eight columns with information about each pet: 'Name', 'Species', 'Gender', 'Age' (in years), 'Fixed', 'Legs', 'Weight' (in lbs), and 'Time to Adoption' (in weeks). Each row corresponds to one pet, and the rows contain complete information for each of the columns.*\n",
    "\n",
    "### Adding new analysis tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Most of the tools we'll look at are accessed the same way.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we find the toolkit online and install it on our system using a !pip install command. \n",
    "\n",
    "Then we import the functions we need from the library included in the toolkit, just like we do with pandas.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try that now!\n",
    "\n",
    "*This section contains tutorials! Get the most out of them by opening a Jupyter notebook in another window and following along. Code snippets provided in the course can be pasted directly into your Jupyter notebook. Review Module 2, Unit 5 for a refresher on creating and opening Jupyter notebooks in Callysto.*\n",

    "### 🏁 Tutuorial: Adding Google Translate to a Jupyter notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 1**\n",
    "\n",
    "Run this code in your Jupyter notebook to install the **Google Translate** software package.\n",
    "\n",
    "    !pip install googletrans\n",
    "    \n",
    "The package usually takes a few moments to install, so we might not see a result immediately.\n",
    "\n",
    "However if the install is successful, we should see a message similar to this a few moments later:\n",
    "\n",
    "![google translate](../_images/Module3-Unit5-image1.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demonstration of what it looks like when we install the 'googletrends' python library. Running !pip install googletrans will generate a message informing where we are in the installation process. A successful installation will finish with the message \"Successfully installed \" followed by the library name and version. In this case \"Successfully installed googletrans-2.4.0\" *\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 2**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that the software is installed, we can import functions from the googletrans library.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we will just import one important item, the Translator.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from googletrans import Translator\n",
    "    translator = Translator()\n",
    "\n",
    "The first line above imports the Translator function, and the second line creates an engine that will do the translation for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step 3**\n",
    "\n",
    "Our translation engine should now be ready! Run the code below to test it.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        translator.translate('bonjour').text\n",
    "        \n",
    "This command should detect that the word bonjour is French and translate it to the same word in English.\n",

    ">By engine we mean a piece of code we install that we will use to run the translations for us.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Google Translate\n",
    "\n",
    "Google Translate is a sophisticated tool that can recognize many languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, here's a command to translate a short Korean phrase.\n",
    "\n",
    "![google translate 3](../_images/Module3-Unit5-image3.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demonstration of translating Korean \"Good evening\" into English using the translator function. We use the following notation to translate into English: translator.translate('안녕하세요.').text*\n",
    "\n",
    "In many cases, Google Translate can figure out the source language on its own, however we can also specify source and destination (output) languages:\n",
    "\n",
    "    translator.translate('castor',src='fr',dest='en').text\n",
    "\n",
    "![google translate 4](../_images/Module3-Unit5-image4.png)\n",

    "*Demonstration of translating a word into a selected language. Using the translator.translate(input word, scr=input language, dest=output language).text function with parameters input word 'castor', input language 'fr' (French), output language ('en') English translates 'castor' from French into English 'beaver'.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Our translation engine can be applied to entire columns of data in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can translate all the entries in the Species column of our pets DataFrame from English to French.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pets['Species'].map(lambda x: translator.translate(x,dest='fr').text)\n",
    "\n",
    "This command uses a lambda function to take a string (x) and run it through the translation engine.\n",

    "### Pyspellchecker\n",
    "\n",
    "The [pyspellchecker](https://pypi.org/project/pyspellchecker/) tool allows us to correct the spelling of words in data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like we did with Google Translate, we first need to install the toolkit into our Callysto Hub.\n",
    " \n",
    "    !pip install pyspellchecker\n",
    "    \n",
    "Once we have received a notification that the package has been successfully installed, we can import the function we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "    from spellchecker import SpellChecker\n",
    "    spell = SpellChecker()\n",
    "The first line above imports the SpellChecker, and the second line creates an engine that will do the checking for us.\n",

    "Try testing it out with a common misspelling.\n",
    "\n",
    "    spell.correction(\"neccesary\")\n",
    "  \n",
    "![spellcheck](../_images/Module3-Unit5-image6.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demonstration of using the correction() function from Python's spellchecker library. To check spelling of a word, import Spellchecker: from spellchecker import SpellChecker and define spell = SpellChecker(). Then call correction as follows: spell.correction('necessary').*\n",
    "\n",
    "Just like with our translation engine, the spell checker can be applied to an entire column in a DataFrame with the help of a lambda function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see what happens when we run the spell checker on the names column in our pets DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "    pets['Name'].map(lambda x: spell.correction(x))\n",
    "\n",
    "![spellcheck 2](../_images/Module3-Unit5-image7.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*Demonstration of spell checking words in a data frame column using the correction function using the Pets dataset \"Names\" column. Output is a list with column values that is indexed. Each row contains a name, ordered as follows: Sasha, Mittena, Sunflower, Sheba, Felix, snowdon.*\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see that the spell checker has output the names column with all the strings it detected as having a spelling error with a \"corrected\" substitution. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we can easily see which names have been left alone and which have been changed because the spell checker doesn't capitalize the first letter.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, we see that the spell checker has “corrected” the name *Snowcone* to come up with *snowdon* (which Snowcone's owner might not be thrilled about). \n",
    "\n",
    "While this tool isn't super useful when applied to a list of names, it's excellent for large data sets that have a lot of descriptions and labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in these values can have a big impact on the quality of our analysis, so being able to run a correction tool can go a long way. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pyspellchecker library is simple but powerful, and it's worthwhile to learn more about it.\n",
