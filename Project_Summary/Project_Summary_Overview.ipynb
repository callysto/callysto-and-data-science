    "1. A **title** that clearly communicates your project's topic and question.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A short **description** of your project, including\n",

    "* The question(s) you are answering.\n",
    "* The data set(s) you are using (include the name of your data source and a link).\n",
    "* A link to the license of the data set(s) being used (if applicable).\n",
    "* An explanation of why you chose this problem, and a few sentences about your assumed audience and how familiar they already are with the subject matter.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Code** that others can re-use to reproduce your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Visualizations** that are clear, accessible and commentedâ€”a few lines describing what the reader should see are sufficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. A **conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure you connect your original questions with what you learned about the data set.\n",
    "Reinforce any important information you discovered while creating the notebook.\n",
