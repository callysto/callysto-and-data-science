    "Now that we're familiar with some tools used for working with data, let‚Äôs talk about analyzing and interpreting data. Analyzing and interpreting data is a big topic. In this course, we're focusing on the basic descriptive analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "The role of data analysis and interpretation is to summarize our findings into key points of information. This helps us to understand the elements that are most relevant to our needs and to make decisions based on those elements, rather than trying to absorb and use the mass of raw data on its own.\n",
    "\n",
    "person typing on a MacBook Pro\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, suppose you were interested in applying for a job at a large enterprise and were curious about typical employee salaries. If you had access to a data set of current employee salaries, this information could tell you about what kind of salary you could expect if you landed the role.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the data set for a large enterprise would likely contain a lot of entries. The data set could also include a wide variety of variables such as the role title, previous experience, years with the company, education, benefits package, vacation days and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see trends that are relevant to your needs and interests, you would need to do some analysis. Let‚Äôs say you computed the average salary of all employees and found it was $30,000 per year. Depending on what you're used to, this might sound like an okay starting salary. However with deeper inspection and the use of some data visualizations you could get a much more detailed idea of what to expect.\n",

    "\n",
    "*Both bar charts show the salary for employees at a company. In the first bar chart, everyone makes $50K, represented by a single bar at 50K. In the second bar chart, one bar shows 19 people making zero dollars, the other bar shows one person making a millions dollars.*\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "We also saw that we need to be careful with correlation coefficients. The computer will always return a number between -1 and +1 when computing a correlation coefficient, but it does not tell you whether it was appropriate to compute such a number. \n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, when we were looking at Alertness charts, even if the data followed a nice quadratic pattern, the correlation coefficient seems to indicate there was no correlation between the variables of Time since waking and Level of alertness.\n",
    "\n",
    "![3 graphs](../_images/Module5-Unit6-image2.png)\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Both of these scatter charts show 20 data points measuring the level of alertness as a percentage versus time of day, as measured in hours from time of waking. The data in the first scatter chart shows a roughly linear trend, going from 0% at 0 hours to 80% at 20 hours. The data in the second scatter chart shows a parabolic trend, starting from 0% at 0 hours, rising to a maximum of 100% at 10 hours, then dropping back to 0% at 20 hours.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Correlation calculations of the above data visualizations suggest in the first plot that Level of alertness is closely correlated with *Time since* waking (corr = 0.95), while in the second one they are not correlated (corr = -0.17).\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, clearly they both show strong patterns of dependence. The issue here is the non-linearity in the second curve, which correlation coefficients don‚Äôt deal with very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fitting curves to data is another place to be careful ‚Äî the computer will always try its best to fit the curve you request, even if the curve is not appropriate for the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose we tried to fit an exponential curve to our Alertness data. The code is similar to before, except we try to fit a curve of the form y = a * e^(bx).\n",
    "\n",
    "The code for fitting the data looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "    def func(x,a,b):\n",
    "        return a*exp(b*x)\n",
    "\n",
    "    curve_fit(func, x, y)\n",
    "    \n",
    "This code returns the best values for parameters a and b:\n",
    "\n",
    "    [59.8192, -.0084185]\n",
    "    \n",
    "This may look like a perfectly reasonable answer, but look at what happens when we plot this curve with the data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "![5 graphs](../_images/Module5-Unit6-image4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "*This scatter plot show 20 data points indicating alertness as a function of time. Alertness goes from 0% to 100% after 10 hours, then dropping back to 0% at 20 hours. The fitted curve looks roughly linear, and runs through the middle of the data. The curve is a very bad fit, representing the fact that this mathematical model is not approrpriate for this data.*\n",
    "\n",
    "The curve does run through the middle of the data, but it doesn‚Äôt fit very well! The problem here is that the exponential curve is a poor choice to model this data.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, the computer doesn‚Äôt know it is a poor choice, so you need to inspect the results critically before drawing any conclusions.\n",
