    " \n",
    "Data science can be a powerful critical thinking tool, but mistakes or distortions can also mislead us. Just as we teach students media literacy and fact-checking, it‚Äôs important to introduce students to critical thinking about data science.\n",

    "Let's say we wanted to use data to predict the number of Elvis impersonators at some point in the future. From our research, we learn that in 1977 there were 170 Elvis impersonators and in the year 2000 there were about 85,000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assuming **exponential** growth, we would extrapolate that by 2020 there should have been 21,912,675 Elvis impersonators.\n",

    "\n",
    "As we've explored, data analysis can help us make decisions. Unfortunately, bias in data collection, cleaning or analysis can result in decisions that are harmful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine being asked to fill out a survey that included questions like ‚ÄúIs a longer school day a good idea or a great idea?‚Äù or ‚ÄúHave you stopped hitting your students?‚Äù \n",
    "\n",
    "Surveys that use **leading questions** or **loaded questions** like these will produce biased data. But while many people can identify this type of poor question design, other collection methods may be more subtle.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if a researcher collects data from a sample that is not representative of the population they intend to study, their data will be biased and any conclusions they make about that population will likely be faulty.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "The book [Weapons of Math Destruction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction) provides a variety of examples of ‚Äúhow big data increases inequality and threatens democracy,‚Äù including the [IMPACT Teacher Evaluation System](https://dcps.dc.gov/release/american-university-partners-dcps-research-impact-teacher-evaluation-system). IMPACT is intended to evaluate teachers' performance and reward them for doing a good job. However, in addition to concerns related to the reliability of the measurements over time and between administrators, evaluations rely heavily on student test scores, which tend to be strongly correlated to socioeconomic factors. For example, see this article from the Journal of Poverty: [Socioeconomic Status and Intelligence: Why Test Scores Do Not Equal Merit.](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J134v08n03_05)\n",

    "Ideally, the data we use to gain insights and make decisions should be both accurate and precise. This means that the values we have collected are closely aligned with reality, and are consistent with subsequent measurements.\n",

    "\n",
    "Just as critical thinking is necessary when navigating data science referenced in the media, we should ask questions when data science is driving decisions that we or others make.\n",
    "\n",
    "* What are the possible biases of the authors, promoters, or funders?\n",
    "* Are the data or analytics being chosen to support or promote a particular worldview?\n",

    "\n",
    "In the U.S., teacher Value Added Models (VAM) have been used to measure the [impact](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.104.9.2593) teachers have on student test scores and contribute to a teacher‚Äôs [evaluation](https://www.nassp.org/policy-advocacy-center/nassp-position-statements/value-added-measures-in-teacher-evaluation/) score. Now, imagine that you are a teacher who is assigned an evaluation score every July based on your students‚Äô test scores as well as other metrics. Talk to a friend or family member about what questions you might have.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Example questions*\n",
    "* As we consider how to integrate data synthesis and artificial intelligence in our classrooms in safe and supportive ways, in your opinions, what kinds of metrics are ethical in learning spaces? Why are some metrics more or less ethical than others? What can we do as educators to ensure that we provide some ethical context around metrics and data collection for assessment? What are the possible implications of collecting data for assessments and teacher practice?\n",
    "* When the test scores were assigned, would there be a way to distinguish how the test score was collected? What kind of story would the test score tell? Would all tests score narratives be equal?\n",
    "* What kinds of metrics would be most valuable to you in terms of student scores on a test or exam? What would the scores reveal to you? What changes might you make to your practice, based on an analysis of student test scores?\n",
    "* What kinds of questions would you have regarding the type of evaluation, which students took the evaluation, what the evaluation was testing, who was going to use the data from the evaluation, how others might use the data, how long the data would be stored for and where it would be stored?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have access to increasing amounts of information, it is imperative that we learn how to critically evaluate information and information sources. As educators, we can positively impact our future society by fostering these skills in our students.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the next unit, we'll look at how to get started with data science.\n",
